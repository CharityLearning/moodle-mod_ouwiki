OU wiki
=======

Copyright 2012 The Open University


This is an alternative wiki that you can install into standard Moodle.

It does not replace the standard wiki, and operates alongside it. The key
intention of this wiki is to provide a simple teaching tool suitable for
student use with minimal required training. It is in no way intended to be
a full-fledged wiki like MediaWiki. For example, there is no wiki syntax
except [[links]].


Branch:

This is the MOODLE_21_STABLE branch. This branch is configured to match the latest
stable branch at the Open University that uses Moodle 2.1.

We have stopped using Moodle 2.1, there will be no more fixes in this branch
(but of course anyone can fork the reposistory and make a fixed version).

Support:

We cannot offer direct support. Please do not contact me directly. If you
need assistance, try the wiki forum on moodle.org. (Remember to make clear
that you are using OU wiki and not the standard forum.)

Bug reports:

Please report bugs to the Moodle tracker using the 'contributed code' project
and 'Module: OU wiki' component. Under Version, please select your Moodle
version e.g. 2.1, 2.2.

Status:

Live quality code that matches our live Moodle 2.1 system.

Please note that this code is tested on OU systems but we rely on the
community for testing on other systems.

Requires:

Moodle 2.1+
Postgres / MySQL

Install:

Place the contents of this source tree into your Moodle installation so that
within your Moodle root, this file is mod/ouwiki/README. Then visit the
Moodle notifications page to install.

If you want the forums to be searchable, you also need to install the
local_ousearch plugin. (It is best to do this before using the wiki much,
otherwise it takes ages to install as it builds indexes for everything.)
When you install the ousearch plugin, a search box will automatically appear.

Documentation:

None. Please feel free to contribute documentation in the relevant area of
the MoodleDocs wiki.
